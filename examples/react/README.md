# React + RESTore Demo

This example code showcases how to use RESTore with React 16.4+

It leverages the new “suspending” support in React to simplify the handling of asynchronous operations. It also showcases the use of:

- The new Context API (Available on React 16.3+)
- `React.unstable_AsyncMode`
- `React.Timeout`
